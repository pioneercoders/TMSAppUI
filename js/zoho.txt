Greetings from Zoho Mail Services.

The Mail Rate Exceeded block has been imposed to avoid any misuse of Zoho Mail.
As per product design, Zoho mail is for Business emails and not suitable for mass mailing.

From logs, we see that the user is sending the same email to multiple recipients (looks like mass mailing).

This is just a temporary block, and you will be able to send mails again automatically. However,
 if you send more number of mails in a short span of time your account will get blocked again.

So you can either control the number of mails you send or you can try Zoho Campaigns, where you have no such limits in sending mails.

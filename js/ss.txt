I wish there are 8 days a week and 25 hours a day
So that I can be with you longer each day
For I can’t get enough of you.
I miss you already, I love you.

Your love is my inspiration.
Without you, I just can’t imagine how my life would be
I’m glad God gave me as special as you.
I love you.

I’d rather be in your heart, than in your mind.
For the mind can forget, the heart will always remember.
I love you, my dearest.

I would give you the stars and the moon if I just could
Just to show how much I love you.
It’s just too bad, I couldn’t.
So just let me be by your side and show my love for you forever.
I love you very much.

If I will be given a chance to ask one wish, I’d only wish one thing.
I would wish that we would grow older together
And our love would last forever.

I love your smile
You’re simply my style
What more can I ask
I just want our love to last
Coz you are one of a kind
I can’t get you off my mind.
I love you.

I found a flower blooming inside my heart – do you know the name of the flower?
I found a spark in my eyes – do you know the name of the spark?
I found the answer at last – it’s the LOVE I have on you,
Yes I love you so much and you mean everything for me my darling

Love is a miracle happening inside the heart;
The miracle happened to me too,
I have fallen in love with you at the moment when I saw you for first time.
I love you
